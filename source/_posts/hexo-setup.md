## Hexo Setup
This was both easier and harder than I'd thought.

The [setup docs](https://hexo.io/docs/) for Hexo is actually very straight forward.  The hard part came when picking a stupid theme.

The first thing was picking a [theme](https://hexo.io/themes/) at all.  Most are kind of flashy.  I guess people want to show off Javascript frontend tricks.

I wanted something simple and finally settled on the default [Light theme](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-theme-light) mainly because it worked out of the box.  The one extra I wanted was a twitter widget.  Maybe next time.

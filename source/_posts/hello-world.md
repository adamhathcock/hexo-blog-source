## Back in the game

I figured I needed to start blogging or, at least, link-blogging again.  Mostly to catalog what I've been doing so I don't repeat myself.

These days, I'm really into getting [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io/) into Docker and doing a lot with AWS at work.  However, I want to branch out from that and [SharpCompress](https://github.com/adamhathcock/sharpcompress) which has been in a holding pattern for a while.

I'm doing this blog in [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) to ease more into the Node/Javascript world.  I also need to gain experience with Azure as a lot of the cool kids are doing that as well and I don't want to get rusty.
